# Initial draft:

# The potential weakness of correcthorsebatterystable password generation

# The situation:
Creating passwords with four random words has a potential weakness, and that weakness is based on people
being lazy and instead of using four random words they use four words that can be associated with them.

Any company known to encourage this type of password generation is at risk. Individuals who use these practices
are also at risk.

# How the attack can play out:
A crafty attacker could build a Markov Chain specifically designed to analyze large swathes of text from the 
target's social media profiles. Special attention would be given to verbs, nouns, and dates. The Markov Chain
would arm the attacker with the words that the target uses the most, and the things that are most important to 
the target.

A specialized word list could then be generated, which permutates not through individual characters, but rather
through the words most commanly used by the target. With more processing power and more thought an attacker
could take this even further; research on words, particularly nouns, most commonly used by people in general.

This is an open criticism of the correcthorsebatterystable approach to generating passwords.
