Threat Model: 
    Liliana is a gifted young lady who has a musical mind. She's spent the past few years composing new songs. She hopes to one day have her music featured on a major motion picture soundtrack. She uses social media to connect and reach out to other artists and contacts to try and get her music in the hands of the right people.
    As a product of the modern age she rarely uses pen and paper and conducts all of her business electronically through various banking and money management applications. She has full confidence in the applications she uses and doesn't consider how or if they might be compromised. Her phone is her primary connection to the outside world her laptop is primarily used to compose and create her music scores. 
    She uses her favorite music creation application; she has found a free version on the internet; but it's a few updates behind the most current pay-to-use version of the same software. While she doesn't pay for the application she does have to purchase music for inspiration; and the simplest way is to utilize the music creation applications store where she can find like-minded peoples ideas and music; and if she ever wants to monetize her compositions she needs to be sure she is completely legal in regards to the music she is reading/listening to for inspiration. If she sees something that she wants to purchase she doesn't want to be bothered with locating her credit card and has setup quick pay and stored her financial information on the applications store section.
