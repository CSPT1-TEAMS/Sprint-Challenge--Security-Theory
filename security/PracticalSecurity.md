I looked at all the links on the readme.  Some of the technology seems a bit overkill for my current security needs.  Nevertheless, it was interesting to see the services for 2 factor authentication.  My banks on the US use SMS and email authentication, which is an absolute killer since I don't have the same phone number here. I have to wait until I travel back to the US if I ever have any big changes to make. In mainland China we had SMS and a hard token authentication.  I prefer that combo a bit more, but once again it became a killer when I left my mainland China phone number. Now, while I can still deposit money and withdraw money, I can't use online banking anymore. I'm limited to ATM interaction or face to face.  
The sandbox information was also interesting. On my windows, my anti-virus provides a sandbox website to access websites like our banks. I've tried to use it but the slow speed it works at usually keeps me from wanting to use it further. 
Out of the links in the readme, I plan to download either keepass or lastpass to improve my security. I think a password manager could be useful, even though I am not quite trusting. I have to do further research though, as a lot of these extra security factors are not very compatible with people like me who travel quite often/ change residences accross countries/  use different computers.
