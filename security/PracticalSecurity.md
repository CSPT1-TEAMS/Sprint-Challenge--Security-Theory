In order to protect myself the simplicist thing i did was change my password to something that has at least 10 characters, I also made up words for my password. I have a real problem with remembering my password, I can always store my passwords in something at home or use a service that charges to keep my passwords safe (but that might be a risk if they are somehow hacked). 

I have also implemented two factor authentication for some of my personal accounts.
