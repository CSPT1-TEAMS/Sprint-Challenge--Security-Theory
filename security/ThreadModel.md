Mary owns a local flowershop. She has regular customers for large events. She saves the credit card information for convience. She has lots of competitors but,has no known enemies. 

Mary stores all the clients information in a computer at the floral shop. The computer uses business management software and business email services. To access her clients information she uses an encrytped password. She stores this password in her phone which can be unlocked with a fingerprint scan. 

Possible adversaries are other floral shops who want to gain access to her clients and ruin her business. She may also have unknown enemies that want to see her business fail. 

In order to protect the client it is important to know if the business management software she uses is secure enough. 

She should also ensure that she does not download any possible virus that can harm her computer. 

She must also make sure she keeps her password secure and be sure no one has access to it. Any person posing as customer support trying to gain access to her person information should be viewed as a possible threat. 

To keep her password from being stolen, she should update her password periodically and make sure no one will ever have access to it. She should also make sure she has the correct mobile security installed onto her phone. It might also be good if she stores her clients personal information at her home where there is less risk.
